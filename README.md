Title: ToDo List Application
About: 
This is my first college mini project created in a team in sem 3. It is a simple to-do list application built using Python's Tkinter library.

Features:
Add Task: Users can add tasks by entering them into the input field and clicking the "Add Task" button.
Delete Task: Individual tasks can be deleted by selecting them from the list and clicking the "Delete Task" button.
Delete All Tasks: Users can delete all tasks at once by clicking the "Delete All Tasks" button. A confirmation dialog is displayed before deleting all tasks.
Exit Application: Users can exit the application by clicking the "Exit" button. All tasks are printed to the console before the application is closed.
